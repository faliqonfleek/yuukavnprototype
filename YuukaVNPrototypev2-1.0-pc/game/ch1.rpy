    "I opened my eyes and saw a bunch of blurred silhouettes, they were small and were definitely running towards me"

    "As I try to get up, I'm reminded once again why they tell you in the first aid course to never move a person who probably has a concussion."

    "I fall on my stomach as those figure approach even more...Damn! it's getting hard staying awake."

    "Suddenly someone kneels right beside me. I open my eyes to see this person."

    y "It's gonna be ok! We'll protect you! Just stay still."

    "Who are these people? More importantly, where am I? "

    "I  look around me...It seems like I'm in a plain, nothing but grass around me."

    "Then, my sight falls on the girl near me. She's using a pink dress, her face looks human but her ears, or the thing at the top of her head, they're... mouse ears?"

    y "More like Koala ears, now like I said, stay still"

    "Crap! I must've said that out loud!"

    m "Wha-What's happening? Who are you? Where am I? "

    y "We're-"

    "Before she can even begin her sentence we hear a metal strike, followed by some moans of pain. The other two guys  were fighting the little creatures."

    show marcoss angry

    mar "You can save it for later, for now heal him and get him out of here!"

    "The...koala girl started concentrating and some kind of light started to emanate from her hands."

    "It...feels...relaxing, I guess and the pain is definitely disappearing."

    "After a little while, the light fades away."

    y "Okay, this is all I can do for now."

    show canlu nervous at right

    c "Well, it'll have to be enough, now start running!"

    mar "That goes for the rest of us too, more are coming! Let's go!"

    "From the mountains we can see a lot...and I mean A LOT of those creatures coming this way."

    "I try to get up but my legs can't really support my weight.  I must be worse than I thought."

    "Suddenly I feel someone picking me up, it was the big guy with kangaroo ears."

    c "Sparas, we're retreating, we need covering fire!"

    "The dog-eared man talked to a small crystal, like it was some sort of phone,
    something I was about to regard as ridiculous until a voice came out of that crystal."

    show sparas calm at left

    s "My dear, you need to stop talking and move your legs, I'm already covering you"

    "It was the voice of a woman, she sounded awfully calm despite the situation."

    "We...or more like they, continued running towards the trees, meanwhile it became more
    and more difficult for me to stay awake."

    mar "Hang on there, kid, we're almost out of danger!"

    c "I wouldn't count on it, don't they seem faster than normal."

    mar "That's just because you're slow."

    c "I'm running at the same speed as you! What are you talking about?"

    y "Guys! How about you use that energy to run faster?"

    "Dammit, I think...I'm gonna fall asleep...I can't..."

    s "Guys, they are definitely faster than normal and that's not all, the
    group is about 10 times bigger than it should be."

    y "That's impossible, they only travel in groups of 10 or 15,
    what is happening?"

    mar "Damnit! We're not gonna make it!"

    y "Yeah we are!"

    "Their voices are getting muffled and it feels like I'm about to fall asleep any
    second now....What?..."

    "I see the koala girl turn around to face the gremlins...what is she thinking?..."

    "The last thing I see before it becomes impossible for me to stay awake,
    is this girl raising her arms, followed by a light emanating from her..."

    "I wake up laying on a bed, but...where am I? I don't recognize this place. What happened?"

    "There's a big window in front of me, it seems like it's night already, what time is it?"

    "I'm still dizzy, but it doesn't matter, I need to get out of here or at least know what's happening."

    "I try to get up but, once again, I'm way too dizzy so I end up just falling on my knees."

    "While I lay there, wondering what to do next, I hear the door opening."

    show marcoss happy

    mar "Hey! What are you doing? You're not completely healed yet.
    Come on, let me help you."

    "The big guy with the kangaroo features helps me sit on the bed once again. As soon as
    I'm there more people start entering the room, I assume they're the ones who saved me."

    show sparas happy at right

    s "Hey, look who's up!"

    y "How are you doing? You sure you're well enough to be up already?"

    s "Nah, guy's looks sturdy enough, ain't that right?"

    "I recognize the koala girl but not the other one, she has...I guess the
    best way to describe it would be “\Spider features“\...this is
    getting crazier...what next? A wombat man?"

    "While I'm having these thoughts the so-called spider starts touching
    my arms and shoul---wait what?!?"

    s "See? Sturdy...not very muscly but it'll do...wanna touch?"

    "The other three just watched somewhere between dumbfounded and exasperated...
    which tells me this isn't the first time she does something like this...
    or the last time."

    show canlu nervous at left

    c "{i}*sigh*{/i} Sparas, you're making him uncomfortable."

    s "Oh my! Really? Am I?"

    "Did she really not noticed or is she playing dumb?"

    m "Ye-yeah, kinda."

    s "I'm sorry, it wasn't my intention to make you uncomfortable."

    "She said with an afflicted expression on her face...while she kept touching me..."

    y "Ok ok, that's enough of that."

    "The koala girl approached us and after making the spider girl stop touching me,
    she looks at me worried."

    y "Are you ok?"

    m "Yeah, it's fine, it was just a little awkward."

    y "I wasn't talking about that."

    m "Oh, yeah, I think I'm fine."

    mar "Fine? You could barely stand up! You need more treatment or at least rest more."

    s "What a wonderful idea! Come on, we're going to my house!"

    "She starts pulling me by the arm while sporting a happy expression."

    "{b}BONK{/b}"

    "The kangaroo guy karate chops the girl on the head."

    s "Ouch, what was that for!?"

    y "You'll have to forgive our friend, she's always been fascinated with
    finding new and rare...things."

    m "I take it that means in this world there are no humans."

    c "Why is it that you don't look too surprised about all this?"

    m "I could ask you the same question...Believe me, it's not that I'm entirely calm,
    I think it's more like, I haven't finished processing all this."

    mar "It's ok, we understand. Let's start by introducing ourselves!"

    s "Little late in the game, don't you think?"

    mar "My name is Marcoss! Member of the Urbem Concitant Team!
    I guess you could say I'm the heavy fighter."

    c "Which is a fancy way of saying he's just a dumb muscle...Name's Canlu,
    that's all you need to know about me."

    s "My name is Sparas, I'm a Huntsman spider, I'm 23 years old,
    I like to play around with new things, also-"

    y "Ok, that's more than enough. My name is Yuuka, magic user of this team."

    m "I'm [name], and, thanks...for helping me. Speaking of which, what happened? Where am I?"

    mar "Seems like I'm not the only one who like to ask questions really late, huh."

    mar "Well, for starters, it seems like you managed to travel from one dimension
    to another, unfortunately, instead of appearing directly on the ground,
    you did it 30 meters in the air, and well, gravity did its work."

    y "Right, I was able to cure most of your injuries."

    m "Then why am I still dizzy?"

    s "Well, magic can can only do so much, and it might have to do with the
    whole dimension traveling thing."

    y "I'm sorry we can't do more for you."

    m "Please, you guys saved me, not just from my injuries but also from from
    those things...so, thanks... but wait, I still don't know where I am.
    What is this place? How did I get here?"

    c "You're in Australia, the place you landed on is part of the Great Forest of
    Ootmay and this Yuuka's house. As for how you managed to get to this world,
    well, we think it's probably because of that book."

    "He points at a book on top of a small table...isn't that...the book I just bought?"

    m "That thing? But, that's just something I bought from an old lady. It's just a
    book...a very expensive normal book."

    s "That “\normal“\ book is a powerful grimoire, one that has been lost for a very long time."

    m "How powerful are we talking about?"

    s "Well, aside from the obvious, it's said that it can also teleport its user
    to anywhere in the world, grant protection against almost any magic...
    among other fun tricks!"

    y "What kind of stores do you visit?"

    m "L-Like I said, it was supposed to be just a random book my friend picked up!
    But...wow, to think that it was something like that...
    I feel like I cheated that poor old woman."

    s "Well, that's not all, it's also capable of sealing someone outside of a
    dimension...forever."

    "As she said this last thing the four of them started looking among each other."

    c "What are we waiting for then? Let's go look for the old man!"

    "Canlu, excited, started walking towards the book, ready to grab it and get out
    of the room and do...god knows what with it. But before he could do it a hand stops him."

    s "There's just one tiny problem."

    c "Of course there is, what is it?"

    s "Well...the book can only be used by the person who activated it...in this case..."

    "Sparas stared at me with a smile...which only made feel more worried...
    the other three also stared at me."

    c "You can't be serious, him!? He's just a human, you must be wrong!"

    y "She's not, I can feel it, both [name] and the book are emanating the same energy."

    c "You gotta be kidding me."

    "I mean, I can kinda get why someone would be upset by this, you found a powerful item,
    but it turns out the only one who can use said item is someone who's not even from here...but."

    m "I...don't understand, why is this so bad?"

    c "Why!? Because now our fate lies on the hands of a foreigner, who not only
    doesn't know the first thing about magic, but also doesn't give a crap about
    this world and is more than likely eager to return to his world!"

    mar "Enough!! It isn't the kid's fault, also, I think you're jumping to conclusions...maybe he feels some sense of...
    duty? responsibility? adventure? intrigue? Whatever the word is,
    I'm sure he'll be happy to lend us a hand!"

    "They both sound awfully confident on their beliefs about me..."

    m "What? I...I don't understand...help you with what?"

    y "{i}*sigh*{/i} He's not the only on jumping to conclusions, Marcoss. I think it's best
    if we first explain our situation."

    "Like Canlu said, this is the world of Australia, I don't know how much different
    it's from your original world but based on how long and intently you've been
    staring at us I presume there are not many demi-humans running around."

    m "“\Many“\? I've never seen one...that is if you don't count the cosplayers..."

    y "The what?"

    m "Nevermind...My world is pretty normal, we don't have magic, monsters or demi-humans
    and obviously, up until today I didn't even think dimensional travel was a thing."

    c "Well, it is, so you better-"

    y "Canlu! There's no need to get aggressive...We want his help...not his contempt."

    "Canlu appears to calm down and sits down close to me...Is he trying to put
    pressure on me?...because it's working."

    y "Long story short, our world is in danger thanks to the Crimson Dragon...a
    powerful monster, capable of devouring worlds like it's nothing...and..."

    mar "And now he's here, in this world, we don't know if even by uniting all of the
    armies in all of the kingdoms on this planet are enough to even face him."

    s "But we can, however, send him back in time...way back, even before he was born...
    or created or whatever."

    c "And guess what, the thing, the only thing that can make that happen is that little book
    over there, which wouldn't be so bad...IF WE COULD ACTUALLY USE IT!!! But no, we
    have to depend on thi--"

    "{b}*BAM*{/b}"

    "We all turn to see where that big slam came from."

    "The big guy, Marcoss was it?, had just destroyed a table, which might I add
    was made out of a very thick wood."

    mar "This is the last time, Canlu, stop making those comments!! We need him and you're
    not gonna get us anywhere with your aggressive behavior!"

    c "Tsk"

    "Canlu just got up and left the room, no doubt still upset..."

    y "I'm really sorry about that, believe it or not, he's actually a good person,
    it's just that, well, we've all been through a lot."

    m "It's ok, I understand...not really...but, you know what I mean. Anyway, so, the
    reason you want my help is because I'm the only one capable of using that book,
    correct?"

    m "But if, and this all hypothetical, I decided to help you, what should I do,
    what is your plan?"

    mar "Well, originally the plan was to look for that book, it's said to be the
    only way to find Taluz"

    m "Who?"

    s "A powerful mage and the only one who knows how to send the Crimson Dragon
    back in time...or at least that's what the stories say, that he once
    defeated not only that dragon but many other monsters that once roamed the earth."

    m "Then why not..."

    y "Ask him? Well, because for the last 3 great invasions, great catastrophes
    that involved those great monsters invading the many kingdoms on this planet,
    he didn't raise a finger in order to help, and it's not like he wasn't there."

    y "Taluz is hard to find but never impossible. The kings went to him seeking help...
    but, he just turned them away."

    mar "We don't know why he's refusing to help but...at this point he might be
    our only option, and thus, we need you to help us find Taluz."

    s "I have to warn you though, this involves a lot of risks maybe even life-threatening."

    "What are they saying? Magic? The book? A dragon!? What?..."

    "I turn to look at the three people in front of me, Sparas and Marcoss just keep
    saying stuff, I think something about me staying for more than a week at a time."

    "Again...WHAT?"

    "Yuuka just looks at them a bit worried and then looks at me concerned."

    y "That's!...only if you want, we can't force you to help us, at least we shouldn't.
    It's completely up to you."
